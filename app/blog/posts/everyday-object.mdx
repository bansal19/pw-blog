Writing Prompt: *Choose an everyday object, what story could it tell if it had memory?*

## This is the story of a vitamin water that's been left out in our backyard for some weeks 

I stand here, tirelessly, patiently waiting to either be topped off or drunk to fruition.

The sun rises right behind me, every morning. My inner warm-up, hugging and clenching against the inner surface of my skin.

As the day progresses, I always hear the pitter patter of my roommates coming in and out. It starts off a little something like this, in the morning, early I hear light, quiet, cautious footsteps. The footsteps make their way to the kitchen, and soon hardly out the door. Then louder, more grounded. Footsteps roll in about a half an hour to an hour later, after which I could coffee of noise to start as all my roommates make their way about their day.

Even though on the warm days, my inner boy, I prefer those to the chillier days because at least one of my roommates will join me. I can finally have some company I can hear them talking. Never to me, but it's better that way Because they can't hear me, at least not yet.

The day progresses, some is quieter than others, but the nights are always loud in the wee hours of the night, well pass when the sun is set, a couple of people joined me for a drag or two of a cig. It is advice of my intention, held the smoke of those fresh cigarettes. I sometimes pee over to look my owner in the ice. I wonder if you recognize meâ€¦


Or has he completely forgotten the feeling I gave him or quenching his dry thirst those cigarettes gave him? The thin, dankly cylinders, what is he seeing them anyway?

Those drugs take precious minutes of his life away, wear a wig for me can give him those precious moments back.
