summary: 'build accountability as a solo founder'
---

Since my break-up with my previous co-founder, I haven't moved as fast as I've wanted to. You also might have felt as a solo founder you'd like to have more accountability. This should help you with that. 

# 105 Day Accountability Challenge
15 weeks. 105 days. The contestants must complete their tasks before December 18th, 11:59 PM or they must complete their respective punishments. 

## Jeson’s Task

- Publish at least 50 podcast episodes that abide by the following criteria,
    - 20 min length each,
    - You cannot have the same person on the interview twice, and
    - The interviewer needs to be either a founder, an operator or an investor.
        - Shardul will vet if this qualifies.

## Shardul’s Task

- Release a milestone of the grid congestion software on Twitter/Product Hunt every 2 weeks.
    - Each milestone you publish online needs to have a working demo
        - Jeson will vet if the milestone and demo qualifies.
    - Each milestone needs to solve a problem that someone will find useful and valuable.
    - If you find another product you want to build longer term, and you commit the rest of the time of the challenge to this product, you need to publish that every 2 weeks online. 

## Incentives and Punishments

## Progress Tracking Using Daily Stand Up

10 AM standup every day. Jeson gets to validate Shardul’s idea for the product on product hunt and Shardul gets to vet Jeson’s leads for his podcast to see if they are good enough to qualify. Every stand up is tracked in the website in the [Daily Stand Update](https://chief-death-482.notion.site/e59785cd153748c98ae2015c7e966f66?v=70dc90aff3c14bcb85608c0bc19d8538)
