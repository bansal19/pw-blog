When I was growing up, I used to swim a lot. I lived in a condominium that gave me access to a pool. I used to do around 20-30 laps every session that I swam. My mum would be sitting there, with a magazine or a book in her hand, giving me company. One day, as I was swimming, I observed the sensation of the moment - stroke, stroke, breath, stroke, stroke and I lost the object of focus. I just was. A dozen laps turned into a few dozen, which turned into 50. 60. 70. I can faintly hear my mum asking me something, but I'm *flowing* through water in that moment. Somehow, through observation of the sensation, I'd exited my body. Around lap 80, knowing I can continue to go for longer but my mother getting restless, I exit the pool.

I came across a similar sensation recently which unlocked this memory that I had in my head. I was practicing vipasanna and during this period, I remember sitting down for more than 12-15 minutes made me restless. But, as I observe the sensations - breathe in. breathe out. muscle soreness in left lower back, the moments turn into seconds, minutes and I feel this unstoppable force of *flow*. I am somehow lost in the moment but also, paradoxically, truly present at the same time.

This is my reason to live. I want to live to be present. Any moment that I can think back upon that gave me a tremendous amount of happiness was a moment in which I was present. My interaction with technology was a minimum. My time with people, with loved ones, friends, family was at the core of the memory.

At any moment, if I wish to ease the moment's passing, observation is the ultimate weapon in my arsenal.
